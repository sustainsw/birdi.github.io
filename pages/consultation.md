BIRDI is co-designed by people with lived experience of the disease and public members. It is overseen by a study oversight committee and a dedicated public and patient engagement group which includes people with lived experience of TBI. Their views are incorporated into our work. We would love to hear your views on our project, which you can give by filling our [feedback survey]({% link pages/feedback.md%}). 

Before we analyze any data we will tell as many people as possible what we are doing. We will ensure that people have the opportunity to [opt out]({%link pages/optout.md%}) of the use of their data for this research project. We will ensure that anyone who has joined the [NHS England data opt out register](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-data-opt-out) is not included in our research.
