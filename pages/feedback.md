## Introduction

Thank you for taking your time to complete this feedback on our project, **"Brain Injury outcomes using Routine Data and Imaging"**.

It is important for us to gain this feedback so we can ensure our research is performed in an ethical, legal way.

The survey shouldn't take longer than **5-10 minutes** to complete. It consists of **6 questions** with the option to add comments should you choose.

---

## Which of the following best describes you (select all that apply)?

- [ ] I have had a traumatic brain injury
- [ ] I am a spouse of or carer for someone who has had a traumatic brain injury
- [ ] I have a family member who has had a traumatic brain injury
- [ ] I know someone who has had a traumatic brain injury
- [ ] I am a healthcare professional
- [ ] None of the above apply

## Why are we conducting this research?

Traumatic brain injury (**TBI**) is injury to the brain caused by an external force. As our population has aged, **TBI has become increasingly common in older people**. Currently, we have limited knowledge on the underlying health problems that might affect recovery from a head injury in older people, which is important to consider when making decisions on the right treatment.

Early decision-making for TBI patients is vital, in particular, deciding **which patients would benefit from surgery or specialist care**. At the time of injury, patients are often unable to take part in these decisions as the injury can make them drowsy and not able to think clearly. Doctors consider multiple factors such as **age, general fitness, health problems**, and **input from family/friends** when making these decisions. 

All patients with a suspected brain injury have a **scan of their head (brain imaging)**. This shows how bad the injury is and helps determine if an operation is needed.

## What are the objectives of our research?

Our project has two objectives:

1. **Support decision-making** by developing a tool that predicts a patient’s likelihood of survival after a head injury, whether they had surgery.
2. **Use this programme** to guide discussions between doctors and family/friends.

**Do you believe these study aims and objectives are important?**

- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No  

**Do you have any comments about the study aims and objectives?** *(optional)*

## How do we plan on conducting this research?

We plan on using a **powerful computer tool called artificial intelligence (AI)**, which is particularly suited to finding complex patterns within large databases. AI requires a **large amount of data** to work most effectively.

### What data will we use?

When someone visits a hospital, they often undergo multiple tests:

- **Physical examination**
- **Blood tests**
- **Heart scans**
- **Brain imaging (CT/MRI scans)**
- **Electronic health records**

Every day, **hundreds of people** visit hospitals, generating a massive amount of **data stored on NHS servers**. We will analyze data such as brain scans, past medical history, and blood test results to develop a **computer programme that predicts someone’s risk of having a TBI**.

**Do you believe it is appropriate to use NHS data in this way?**

- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No  

**Do you have any comments about the way we plan on using NHS data?** *(optional)*

## Protecting Your Data

Since we will analyze data from **approximately 4,500 patient records**, gaining consent from each individual is **not feasible**. Therefore, we will be using people's data in this research **without explicit consent**. However, we ensure strict **data protection measures**:

### 1) Storage and De-Identification of Data
- Identifiable data will only be handled on **NHS IT systems** by trained NHS staff.

### 2) Subject Identification
- Patients with **TBI** will be identified from hospital records.
- Matched control groups (patients with similar tests but no TBI) will be included.

### 3) Data Linkage
- Medical records from different databases (e.g., ECG, brain scans) will be **linked** using NHS numbers.

### 4) De-Identification
- **All identifiable information (name, address) will be removed** before data analysis.
- An **audit** will ensure the dataset remains de-identified.

### 5) Opt-Out Option
- Patients who do not wish to participate can opt out via **the NHS England ‘data opt-out register’** or through our local website.

**Do you think this is an appropriate way to handle and protect patient data?**

- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No  

**Do you have any comments on the way we handle, store, and protect data?** *(optional)*

## Expanding the Research

To **improve the accuracy** of our programme, we anticipate expanding the study to **GP surgeries and other hospitals**. This may require **trained NHS staff outside of routine care teams** to handle identifiable data before it is anonymized. In such cases, we will seek approval from **the Confidentiality Advisory Group of the Health Research Authority**.

**Under these circumstances, is it appropriate for trained NHS staff (not part of the routine care team) to handle data in this way?**

- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No  

**Do you have any comments regarding the handling of patient data by trained NHS staff who are not part of the routine clinical care team?** *(optional)*

---

## Public Involvement

We believe it is important to involve the **general public** and **people with lived experience of TBI** in the design of this project.

**Is there anything else you would like to see included in the design of this study?** *(optional)*

This might include:

- Additional outcomes to measure
- Other areas of research you find important
- How this research could be used to benefit TBI care in the future

## Final Thoughts

**Is there anything else you would like to add?** *(optional)*
